title: Bloom Filter
---

A `BloomFilter` is space-efficient probabilistic set based on hash functions.

This means that, like a classic `Set`, you can add items to it and ask whether the item exists in it. The twist is that if the filter answers no, you can be sure about it, but if the filter answers yes, it might be wrong.

Basically, a `BloomFilter` cannot answer with false negatives but can answer with false positives.

Moreover, because it stores information on byte arrays, a `BloomFilter` cannot have a dynamic size and one cannot iterate over its items since it does only store "traces" about inserted items.

For more information about the `BloomFilter`, you can head [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter).

```js
const BloomFilter = require('mnemonist/bloom-filter');
```

Note that by default, this implementation uses `murmurhash3` and is designed to store strings only.

## Constructor

The `BloomFilter` takes a single argument being its desired capacity.

Alternatively, you can provide a configuration object if you also need to tweaks some things such as its error rate etc.

```js
// Creating a bloom filter that can hold 50 items
const filter = new BloomFilter(50);
```

```js
// Passing custom options
const filter = new BloomFilter({
  capacity: 2500,
  errorRate: .05
});
```

### Static #.from

Alternatively, one can build a `BloomFilter` from an arbitrary JavaScript iterable likewise:

```js
const filter = BloomFilter.from([1, 2, 3], options);
```

## Members

* [#.capacity](#capacity)
* [#.errorRate](#errorate)
* [#.hashFunctions](#hashfunctions)

## Methods

*Mutation*

* [#.add](#add)
* [#.clear](#clear)

*Read*

* [#.test](#test)

### #.capacity

Total number of items the filter is able to store.

```js
const filter = new BloomFilter(5);

filter.capacity
>>> 5
```

### #.errorRate

Error rate of the filter. Defaults to `0.005`.

```js
const filter = new BloomFilter(5);

filter.errorRate
>>> 0.005
```

### #.hashFunctions

Number of hash functions.

```js
const filter = new BloomFilter(3);

filter.hashFunctions
>>> 7
```

### #.add

Add the given item to the filter.

`O(k)`, k being the number of hash functions.

```js
const filter = new BloomFilter(5);
filter.add('hello');
```

### #.clear

Completely clears the filter of its items.

```js
const filter = new BloomFilter(5);
filter.add('hello');
filter.clear();

filter.size
>>> 0
```

### #.test

Will return `false` if the item is not present in the filter and `true` if the item may or may not be in the filter.

`O(k)`, k being the number of hash functions.

```js
const filter = new BloomFilter(5);
filter.add('hello');

filter.test('world');
>>> false

filter.test('hello');
>>> true
```
